          <h2>Insights Discovered Looking at 2014 Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Analysis: Percentage of population In Poverty.  The United States has among the largest income-based health 
            disparities in the world. THis analysis confirms this. As the poverty rate increases, there is an increase
            in all health concerns.  A closer look reveals that this trend is magnified in Southeastern states: higher poverty rates
            accompanied by higher incidences of poor health.</p>

          <p>Analysis: Age (Median).  The age effect was mixed. There didn't seem to be a direct corelation between age and 
            health outcomes across the board. The findings indicate that there are other factors beyond age influencing health 
            outcomes. Socioeconomic and behavioral factors seem to have a stronger influence on health ouotcomes than age related 
            effects. Consider West virginia which has a higher age median, better healthcare, but higher percentages of obesity and
            smokers. Also Northeastern States as having a higher age median and better healthcare.</p>

          <p>Analysis: Household Income( Median). On the surface there seems to be a direct relationship between household income and 
            the occurrence of obesity and smoking.  I would submit that the relationship is indirect. High poverty rates would skew 
            median income to the left creating the phenomenon we are seeing. Lower median income is tied to higher poverty rates which
            is tied to higher incidence of obesity and adverse health behaviors (smoking). The data shows that poorer regions of the 
            country tend to have more adverse health conditions  The Southeastern States rank poorer than other states for income and 
            healthcare, and the Northeastern states are faring better.</p>
